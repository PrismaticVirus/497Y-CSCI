# CSCI 497Y Project Log

This is the log for my midterm and final project for Electronic Textiles

## ðŸ““ Project Log #1

Something I liked about the tutorial was how it went over the safety information beforehand.  
Something I didn't really enjoy is that it didn't quite tell you where to locate all of the materials, especially the batting. I had to ask for help to find it.  
If I were to improve the tutorial I would record my own videos in the makerspace instead of using the ones provided by Brother.

I also did the soldering badge, so I thought I would just throw that in here.  
My main problem with the tutorial is that the equipment in the tutorial and what's actually in the kit differ slightly.

## ðŸ““ Project Log #2

**Idea:**  
Use the NeoPixels that were supplied and sew them (along with a button) into a backpack. I might buy more for expansion.

**Libraries:**  
This project will use the [Adafruit NeoPixel Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel).  
(Itâ€™s possible to do it with standard libraries, but I will not be doing that.)

**Timeline:**  
Iâ€™ll dedicate about 20 hours to it, allowing plenty of time for troubleshooting and unexpected issues.

**Challenges:**  
- **Thread resistance:** May need to switch to wire or find a way to boost voltage.
- **Backpack material:** Sewing into the backpack could be difficult depending on its composition.
- **Expandability:** I want the final project to allow for easy upgrades later without a full redesign.

## ðŸ““ Project Log #3


**Progress:**  
- Successfully prototyped the circuit.
- Code is functioning and cycles through lighting effects.
- Wired up NeoPixels and a button.

**Next Steps:**  
- Sew everything into the backpack.
- Finalize microcontroller placement.
- Implement a "hold to power off" feature for the button.

### Update 
Due to constraints with the conducive thread and the backpack material I decied to crochet a braclet and sew the NeoPixel LEDS into that instead.

## ðŸ““ Project Log #4
**Name TBD**
- My idea is to make a glove that you can play a game on
- Depeding if i come up with an original game, recreate an exising game, or use code that already exists for this aspect will determine which game it is

**Parts Required:**
- Glove
- Adafruit Flora
- OLED Screen
- Flex Sensor (or create my own)

**Skills Required**
- Sewing
- Computer Science things (or something idk)

**Similar Projects**

Somones midterm use the same OLED screen im going to use 
*Update Later*

**Pros**
* It will be fun 
* Theres alot of room for creative freedom
* The potential to expand the project (more than one game, etc)

**Cons**
* Medium Expensive
* Will take alot of time if I decide to actually make a game from scratch
* Third thing
